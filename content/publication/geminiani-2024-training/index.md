abstract:"Neuroscience education is challenged by rapidly evolving technology and the development of interdisciplinary approaches for brain research. The Human Brain Project (HBP) Education Programme aimed to address the need for interdisciplinary expertise in brain research by equipping a new generation of researchers with skills across neuroscience, medicine, and information technology. Over its ten year duration, the programme engaged over 1,300 experts and attracted more than 5,500 participants from various scientific disciplines in its blended learning curriculum, specialised schools and workshops, and events fostering dialogue among early-career researchers. Key principles of the programme’s approach included fostering interdisciplinarity, adaptability to the evolving research landscape and infrastructure, and a collaborative environment with a focus on empowering early-career researchers. Following the programme’s conclusion, we provide here an analysis and in-depth view across a diverse range of educational formats and events. Our results show that the Education Programme achieved success in its wide geographic reach, the diversity of participants, and the establishment of transversal collaborations. Building on these experiences and achievements, we describe how leveraging digital tools and platforms provides accessible and highly specialised training, which can enhance existing education programmes for the next generation of brain researchers working in decentralised European collaborative spaces. Finally, we present the lessons learnt so that similar initiatives may improve upon our experience and incorporate our suggestions into their own programme."
