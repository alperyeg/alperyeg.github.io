abstract: "Mounting experimental evidence suggests that brain-state-specific neural mechanisms, supported by connectomic architectures, play a crucial role in integrating past and contextual knowledge with the current, incoming flow of evidence (e.g., from sensory systems). These mechanisms operate across multiple spatial and temporal scales, necessitating dedicated support at the levels of individual neurons and synapses. A notable feature within the neocortex is the structure of large, deep pyramidal neurons, which exhibit a distinctive separation between an apical dendritic compartment and a basal dendritic/perisomatic compartment. This separation is characterized by distinct patterns of incoming connections and brain-state-specific activation mechanisms, namely, apical amplification, isolation, and drive, which are associated with wakefulness, deeper NREM sleep stages, and REM sleep, respectively. The cognitive roles of apical mechanisms have been demonstrated in behaving animals. In contrast, classical models of learning in spiking networks are based on single-compartment neurons, lacking the ability to describe the integration of apical and basal/somatic information. This work aims to provide the computational community with a two-compartment spiking neuron model that incorporates features essential for supporting brain-state-specific learning. This model includes a piece-wise linear transfer function (ThetaPlanes) at the highest abstraction level, making it suitable for use in large-scale bio-inspired artificial intelligence systems. A machine learning evolutionary algorithm, guided by a set of fitness functions, selected the parameters that define neurons expressing the desired apical mechanisms."
summary: "Experimental evidence suggests that brain-state-specific neural mechanisms play a crucial role in integrating past and contextual knowledge with current sensory information, operating across multiple spatial and temporal scales. A new two-compartment spiking neuron model has been developed to support brain-state-specific learning, incorporating features such as apical amplification and isolation, and utilizing a piece-wise linear transfer function to make it suitable for large-scale bio-inspired artificial intelligence systems."
